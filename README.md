# Diagnose the dominant climate factors and periods of spring phenology in Qinling Mountains, China

The important effect of climate factors on spring phenology has been confirmed by numerous studies, but its temporal variation remains unclear. 

Based on the daily meteorological observation data and annual vegetation phenology data from 1987 to 2016, we proposes a Time Window Sliding Fitting (TWSF) method. 

Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is used to investigate the relationship between spring phenology and five climate factors, including mean temperature, total precipitation, mean photoperiod, chilling index and forcing index, in all time windows from December to next May with 7-day interval in Qinling Mountains (QLMs) of China.
